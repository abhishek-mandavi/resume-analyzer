# ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React is a popular open‑source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.
- React Router v7 is the go‑to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—all with a smooth upgrade path from v6.
- Puter.js is a tiny client‑side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) straight into your browser app—no backend needed and costs borne by users.
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.
- Zustand is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.

# 🔋 Features
👉 Easy & convenient auth: Handle authentication entirely in the browser using Puter.js—no backend or setup required.

👉 Resume upload & storage: Let users upload and store all their resumes in one place, safely and reliably.

👉 AI resume matching: Provide a job listing and get an ATS score with custom feedback tailored to each resume.

👉 Reusable, modern UI: Built with clean, consistent components for a great-looking and maintainable interface.

👉 Code Reusability: Leverage reusable components and a modular codebase for efficient development.

👉 Cross-Device Compatibility: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.

👉 Modern UI/UX: Clean, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a sleek user experience.

And many more, including code architecture and reusability.
